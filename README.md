# Password Widget


<a id="org70c9d72"></a>

# Description

This project is essentially a wrapper around KeepassXC. It uses the keepassxc-cli to interact with password database files. I had been using KeepassXC, but it was cumbersome to open the application, select the password, and manually copy it using Ctrl+C. My solution is a much faster, mouseless interface.

Unfortunately, the UI is not easily customizable since I opted for a highly stylized pixel art approach, which doesnâ€™t lend itself to easy color customization. To create the UI, I used AGS.

This project is essentially a wrapper around [Keepassxc](https://keepassxc.org/).  It uses the [keepassxc-cli](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man1/keepassxc-cli.1.html) to interact with the password database files.  I had been using [Keepassxc](https://keepassxc.org/) however it was cumbersome to opent the application, select the password, and manually copy it using Ctrl+C. My solution is a much faster, mouseless interface.

I went for a very stylized approach with pixel art which came out pretty good.  To actually create the UI I used [AGS](https://github.com/Aylur/ags).

# Installation

if your using nix then its super easy, just add it as in input and put the derivation in your packages

    
    {
      description = "demo flake";
    
      inputs = {
        nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable";
        flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
    
        pix_pass = {
          url = "github:k-kahora/keepassxc-widget";
        };
      };
    
      outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils, pix_pass}:
        flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
          let
            pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
            lib = pkgs.lib;
            pix_pass_pkg = pix_pass.packages.${system}."default";
          in
          {
            devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
              packages = [
                  pix_pass_pkg
              ];
            };
          }
        );
    }
